# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

This is a simple PyTorch implementation of a DCGAN, based on the [PyTorch DCGAN Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html)

### Training:
- Add an image dataset to the workspace
- Set up image dimensions in `config.py`
- Train and save models in `train.ipynb`
- Perform inference on `inference.py` (TODO, make sure the model is saved)
